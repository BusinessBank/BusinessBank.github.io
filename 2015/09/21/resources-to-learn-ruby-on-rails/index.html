            <p>Hi!
I am <a href="https://twitter.com/ohayostudio">Jérôme Sadou</a>, Software Engineer at Business Bank Group, Inc. working on the ALL-IN project.</p>

<p>After more than 10 years working with PHP for my applications back-end, I made the jump to Ruby.
More precisely after using all this time, custom frameworks, Zend 1/2 or Symfony 2, joining Business Bank Group I started to work with Ruby on Rails framework.
This is actually one of the main reason I took this job as I wanted to learn something new (for me) and challenge myself. There are plenty of jobs in PHP (it runs about 80% of the web) and I could continue for a while just with it but I was feeling it was time to try something different and in depth. (I also did some projects using Node.js, a bit of Python and long long time ago Java).</p>

<p>To prepare myself to join the company (I was freelancing for 5 years) I took a course on Udemy : &quot;Getting started with Ruby on Rails&quot; by Paul Krause. The course is a good introduction to Ruby and Rails. For a programmer beginner there&#39;s quite enough to learn even in HTML5 and CSS3 towards the end of the course, for a more experienced developer in an other language like me, it was good enough to &quot;hold my hand&quot; for a start but then it was a bit slow. But I think it was a good idea to follow the course to get the basis right.</p>

<p>After following 40% of the course I built a small app to test my knowledge, a simple API app with a front-end in AngularJS as it was the couple I was going to use the work on ALL-IN. 
Obviously building something is the best way to learn as you quickly encounter real world problems like : &quot;how to upload pics to AWS through my API when using Heroku&quot; for example. Just with something as simple as this kind of task, you learn a lot.
And it gave me a bit of confidence before to join the team.</p>

<p>There are many ways to learn about Ruby and Ruby on Rails online. In Japan, books are also still very popular, there is a full range of Ruby (or any language) books published, nothing to compare with France for example. That surprised me 10 years ago and still impresses me now. As for me I mostly stick to online resources.</p>

<p>So, on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?ref=home&amp;q=ruby">Udemy</a> only, you have a about 50 different courses to learn about Ruby ( / on Rails), it&#39;s up to you to choose the one that will suit you the best depending on your background.</p>

<p>Some other popular or interesting online resources to learn that were pointed at me :</p>

<p>Complete Courses : </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ruby : Learn to program in Ruby, a flexible language used to create sites :
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby">https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby</a> </p></li>
<li><p>Rails : 
<a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails">http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>More advanced :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Screencasts for intermediate Ruby on Rails developers : 
<a href="https://gorails.com/">https://gorails.com/</a> </p></li>
<li><p>Knowing how to write good specs :  &quot;{ rspec guidelines with ruby }&quot; :
<a href="http://betterspecs.org/">http://betterspecs.org/</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>(This was the most difficult part for me to grasp when I joined the team)</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#39;re a Ruby developer, and you&#39;re ready for more :
<a href="http://www.rubytapas.com%5D">http://www.rubytapas.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Learning Ruby on Rails was/is just one part of the things I had to do when joining the ALL-IN project, you can read about our stack in the previous articles (in Japanese, but Google Translate does a pretty good job now) written by our CTO, Takenaka San. You will see that there&#39;s quite some material.</p>

<p>Next time I will pick and share some interesting code snippets that I (or one of my colleagues) wrote during the development of ALL-IN.</p>

<p>If you are up for some challenges in Tokyo or in Matsue (&quot;Ruby City&quot; in Shimane Prefecture), we are recruiting.
Apart from some experience in the web stack we are using or/and an ability to learn fast, speaking and reading a conversational Japanese is preferred.</p>

<p>If you want to meet me, I&#39;ll be at the Matsue Ruby Kaigi 07 on September 26th. [<a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails">http://matsue.rubyist.net/matrk07/#</a>]</p>

<p>よろしくお願いします！</p>
